# The Game Set Up
  1. Clone or download repository
  2. navigate to project folder
  3. run npm start
  4. Open http://localhost:3000 to play the game

# Instructions
- The player needs to discard all 98 cards in the deck onto four discard piles in order to win while following certain rules.
- The player starts 8 cards in their hand and four discard pile prompt cards are on the table: two showing "1" and an up arrow and two showing "100" and a down arrow.
- On a turn, a player must discard at least two cards from their hand onto one or more discard piles
- Cards on the 1 piles are placed in ascending order and cards on the 100 piles are placed in descending order
- You can play a card exactly 10 higher/lower than the top card of a discard pile even when you would normally have to play in a descending/ascending order (e.g., if a 100 discard pile is topped with an 87, you can play any card lower than 87 or you can play the 97)
- After a player finishes their turn, they refill their hand from the deck.
- If you play all 98 cards, you win!
- your final score is the number of cards left in the deck and the cards you haven't played yet. The lower score the better.
